# Why Linear Algebra Is Essential for Designing AI Systems

---

Linear Algebra is fundamentally important for scientists and engineers, and it becomes even more essential in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In this post, I will first provide an intuitive description of what linear algebra is, and then explain why it matters — particularly from the perspective of machine learning.

## "Linear"

Intuitively, *linear* refers to the properties of a line.  
For example, in two-dimensional space (the $xy$-plane), every line can be represented in the following form:

$$
ax + by = c
$$

The operations involved in this expression are **addition** and **scalar multiplication**.  
These two operations lie at the heart of linear algebra.

In fact, one could say that linear algebra is a mathematical framework built upon these two operations.  
It studies the structures and consequences that arise from addition and scalar multiplication.

## "Algebra"

Algebra is the study of **operations** defined on a **set**.

In linear algebra, we primarily deal with:

- Set: **vector space**
- Operations: **addition and scalar multiplication**

Just as algebra defines objects (such as sets, numbers, or functions) and investigates their properties,  
linear algebra defines **vector spaces, vectors, and linear transformations**, and then analyzes and utilizes their structural properties.

In summary, linear algebra can be described in one sentence:

> **A discipline that defines linearity and studies its properties.**

## Why Linear Algebra Matters

The real world is complex.  
Countless interacting factors operate simultaneously, often producing unpredictable outcomes.

Instead of attempting to solve such problems directly, engineers typically engage in **modeling** — transforming real-world phenomena into forms that are more tractable.

If a real-world problem can be modeled in a way that incorporates linearity, we gain access to a powerful set of mathematical tools.  
The structure, role, and applications of these tools are precisely what linear algebra provides.

## Why Linear Algebra Matters for AI

For AI systems to understand the complexity of reality, they must first represent various aspects of the world numerically.

In computer science, data is typically represented as:

- vectors
- matrices
- tensors

To understand how AI models process and manipulate data, one must understand the properties and operations of vectors and matrices — concepts that are developed within linear algebra.

In other words, linear algebra is not merely a mathematical prerequisite for AI;  
it is the language in which AI systems are formulated.
