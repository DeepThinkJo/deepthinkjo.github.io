# Why Linear Algebra Matters?

---

Linear Algebra is fundamentally important for scientists and engineers, and it becomes even more essential in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In this post, I will first provide an intuitive description of what linear algebra is, and then explain why it matters — particularly from the perspective of machine learning.

## "Linear"

Intuitively, *linear* refers to the properties of a line.  
For example, in two-dimensional space (the $xy$-plane), every line can be represented in the following form:

$$
ax + by = c
$$

The operations involved in this expression are **addition** and **scalar multiplication**.  
These two operations lie at the heart of linear algebra.

In fact, one could say that linear algebra is a mathematical framework built upon these two operations.  
It studies the structures and consequences that arise from addition and scalar multiplication.

## "Algebra"

Algebra is the study of **operations** defined on a **set**.

In linear algebra, we primarily deal with:

- Set: **vector space**
- Operations: **addition and scalar multiplication**

Just as algebra defines objects (such as sets, numbers, or functions) and investigates their properties,  
linear algebra defines **vector spaces, vectors, and linear transformations**, and then analyzes and utilizes their structural properties.

In summary, linear algebra can be described in one sentence:

> **A discipline that defines linearity and studies its properties.**

## Why Linear Algebra Matters

The real world is complex.  
Countless interacting factors operate simultaneously, often producing unpredictable outcomes.

Instead of attempting to solve such problems directly, engineers typically engage in **modeling** — transforming real-world phenomena into forms that are more tractable.

If a real-world problem can be modeled in a way that incorporates linearity, we gain access to a powerful set of mathematical tools.  
The structure, role, and applications of these tools are precisely what linear algebra provides.

## Why Linear Algebra Matters for AI

For AI systems to understand the complexity of reality, they must first represent various aspects of the world numerically. In this context, **Vectors and Matrices become essential tools for efficiently handling vast amounts of data**.

1. **Systematic Data Management**: It is impossible to handle data with thousands or millions of features individually. Vectors allow us to represent such high-dimensional data as a single point, while matrices allow us to bundle numerous data sets as a single unit of operation.
2. **Efficiency of High-Dimensional Operations**: The core of machine learning models—data transformation and weight updates—consists of numerous matrix multiplications. Linear algebra provides the mathematical definition for these large-scale data operations and the foundation for computers to process them in an optimized manner.

Ultimately, linear algebra is the **language** that supports the massive system of AI and the **toolbox** for freely manipulating data.
