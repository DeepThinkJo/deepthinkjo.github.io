# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

To analyze a matrix deeply, we must view it as a **Linear Transformation**. Most vectors, when multiplied by a matrix $A$, will change both their magnitude and direction. However, there exist special vectors that stay on the same span—they only change their magnitude (scaling) without changing their direction. Finding these vectors and their scaling factors is the heart of the **Eigenvalue Problem**.

## Definition: Eigenvector and Eigenvalue

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix. A scalar $\lambda$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $A$ if there is a **non-zero vector** $\mathbf{x}$ such that:
$$A\mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x}$$
Such a vector $\mathbf{x}$ is called an **eigenvector** corresponding to $\lambda$.



### Why must the eigenvector be non-zero?
Mathematically, if $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$, the equation $A\mathbf{0} = \lambda \mathbf{0}$ holds true for any $\lambda$, yielding no useful information. 
From the perspective of **Information Theory**, a "surprising" or "specific" event carries more information. Since $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ is a trivial solution that works for every matrix and every scalar, it contains **zero information**. To understand the unique properties of matrix $A$, we must find the **nontrivial solutions**.

## The Process: Finding $\lambda$ and $\mathbf{x}$

Solving the eigenvalue problem follows a systematic three-step process:

### 1. The Matrix Equation Form
We rewrite $A\mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x}$ as:
$$(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$$
While it might seem "tricky" to insert the identity matrix $I$, it is a logical necessity. We are searching for a linear transformation $A$ that acts like a simple scaling. Since every linear transformation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be represented as a matrix, we represent the scaling $\lambda$ as a **scalar matrix** $\lambda I$ (where the main diagonal entries are all $\lambda$).

### 2. The Characteristic Equation
We seek a nontrivial solution for $\mathbf{x}$. As we learned in previous posts, the homogeneous system $(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has a nontrivial solution if and only if the matrix $(A - \lambda I)$ is **non-invertible**.
$$\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$$
This is called the **Characteristic Equation**. The roots of the resulting **Characteristic Polynomial** are the eigenvalues of $A$.

### 3. Finding the Eigenspace
For each eigenvalue $\lambda$ found, we solve the linear system $(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. The solution set (excluding the zero vector) provides the eigenvectors. This set of all solutions is called the **Eigenspace** of $A$ corresponding to $\lambda$.

## Eigenvalue Decomposition (Eigendecomposition)

The most powerful application of these concepts is breaking down a matrix into its fundamental components, often called **Diagonalization**.

### Definitions: Similarity and Diagonalizability
* **Similarity**: Matrix $A$ is similar to $B$ if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $A = PBP^{-1}$. Similar matrices share the same eigenvalues.
* **Diagonalizable**: A square matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix $D$.

### Theorems for Diagonalization
1.  An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is diagonalizable **if and only if** it has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors.
2.  If such eigenvectors exist, $A$ can be decomposed as:
    $$A = PDP^{-1}$$
    * Columns of $P$: The $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors.
    * Diagonal entries of $D$: The eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors in $P$.

## Applications and Efficiency

### 1. Computing Matrix Powers ($A^k$)
In many engineering simulations, we need to compute $A^k$. Multiplying an $n \times n$ matrix $k$ times has a time complexity of roughly $O(k \cdot n^3)$, which is extremely expensive.
If $A$ is diagonalizable:
$$A^k = (PDP^{-1})(PDP^{-1})\dots(PDP^{-1}) = PD^kP^{-1}$$
Since $D$ is a diagonal matrix, $D^k$ is simply the main diagonal entries raised to the power of $k$. This reduces a massive matrix product into a simple scalar power operation.

### 2. The Foundation of AI: SVD and Beyond
In Machine Learning, **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** is used for data compression and noise reduction. Eigendecomposition is a core component of SVD. Mastering this allows us to understand how AI systems "analyze" data by breaking it down into its most significant directions (principal components).

## Deep Thoughts of Jo: Decomposition as Analysis

In science, we analyze complex objects by breaking them down into simpler parts. A matrix is a **Linear Transformation**, and **Matrix Multiplication** is the **Composition** of these transformations. 

Matrix Decomposition ($A = PDP^{-1}$) allows us to view one complex transformation as a sequence of three simpler steps:
1.  **$P^{-1}$**: Changing the coordinate system (basis).
2.  **$D$**: Scaling along the new axes.
3.  **$P$**: Changing the coordinates back to the original system.

If $P$ is **Orthogonal** (a concept we will explore in the next post), this can be geometrically interpreted as:
> **Rotate (without changing magnitude) $\to$ Scale (Shear/Stretch) $\to$ Rotate back.**

By decomposing a matrix, we aren't just doing math; we are dissecting the "DNA" of a linear transformation to see how it moves and shapes the space.
