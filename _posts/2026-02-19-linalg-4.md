# Linear Systems

A **Linear System** is essentially a collection of linear equations involving multiple unknowns. While the definition sounds simple, its implications are profound. Through the process of mathematical modeling, complex real-world problems—ranging from structural engineering to neural network optimizations—can be translated into these systems. As engineers, mastering linear systems is not just an academic exercise; it is the acquisition of a vital tool for solving the problems of reality.

## Linear System and the Nature of Solution Sets

To solve a problem, we must first define it clearly. A linear system is our framework for defining relationships between variables.

### Definition: Linear System
A system of $m$ linear equations in $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is defined as:
$$
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \dots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \dots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m
\end{cases}
$$

### Definition: Solution and Solution Set
A **solution** is a list of numbers $(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)$ that makes each equation in the system a true statement. The **solution set** is the collection of all such possible solutions.

### Theorem: The Three Possibilities
Because these equations possess the property of **linearity**, their solution sets behave in a very specific manner. A linear system has either:
1. **No solution** (Inconsistent)
2. **Exactly one solution** (Consistent)
3. **Infinitely many solutions** (Consistent)

## The Unity of Representation: Systems, Vectors, and Matrices

In the world of Linear Algebra, we often represent the same problem in different forms. We do this not to complicate things, but to utilize different mathematical tools: some forms are better for **calculation** (Row Picture), while others are better for **structural analysis** (Column Picture).

To establish this, let us define the following components:
* **Coefficient Matrix**: $A = [ \mathbf{a}_1 \ \mathbf{a}_2 \ \dots \ \mathbf{a}_n ]$, where each $\mathbf{a}_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a column vector.
* **Variable Vector**: $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]^T \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
* **Constant Vector**: $\mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]^T \in \mathbb{R}^m$.

### Theorem: Triple Equivalence of Linear Systems
Based on the definitions above, the following three representations are **equivalent**, meaning they share the exact same solution set:

1.  **The Linear System Form**:
    $$
    \begin{cases}
    a_{11}x_1 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    a_{m1}x_1 + \dots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m
    \end{cases}
    $$
2.  **The Vector Equation Form**:
    $$x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + \dots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{b}$$
3.  **The Matrix Equation Form**:
    $$A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$$

**Proof & Justification**:

This equivalence follows directly from the **definition of matrix-vector multiplication**. By definition, the product $A\mathbf{x}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$ using the corresponding entries of $\mathbf{x}$ as weights:
$$A\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \mathbf{a}_i = x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + \dots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n$$
This sum results in a vector where each $j$-th entry is exactly the left-hand side of the $j$-th equation in the linear system. Thus, solving for $\mathbf{x}$ in $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ is identical to solving the original system.

## Two Perspectives: Row Picture and Column Picture

Based on the equivalence above, we can gain different levels of insight by categorizing them into the **Row Picture** and the **Column Picture**.

### 1. The Row Picture: Focusing on Individual Equations
This perspective treats the system as a collection of $m$ equations. Geometrically, the solution is the **intersection** of hyperplanes. This view is practical for calculating the actual solution set through row operations.

### 2. The Column Picture: Focusing on Vector Operations
This perspective treats the system as a **Vector Equation**. We look for the coefficients $x_i$ that combine the columns $\{\mathbf{a}_1, \dots, \mathbf{a}_n\}$ to reach the target vector $\mathbf{b}$. This view is essential for analyzing the system's structural properties through concepts like *Spanning* and *Linear Independence*.

## Deep Thoughts of Jo: The Necessity of Elimination Algorithms

Let’s dive into the Row Picture and discuss how to solve these systems. Why do we need formal **Elimination Algorithms**?

**1. Scalability and Computational Efficiency**
Solving a system with two variables is easy. But for an engineer dealing with 1,000 equations, we need a clear, systematic, and algorithmic approach that a computer can execute without making arithmetic errors.

**2. Breaking the "Equation Count" Intuition**
A common naive intuition is that "if # equations = # unknowns, the solution is unique." However, this is **often wrong**. Consider the system $\{x+y=1, x+y=2\}$. Elimination algorithms act as a filter that reveals the true structure and "traps" (contradictions or redundancies) within the system.

## Row Picture: The Mechanics of Row Reduction

To apply the Row Picture systematically, we use matrix notation.

### Definition: Coefficient Matrix and Augmented Matrix
For a system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, the **Coefficient Matrix** ($A$) contains only the $a_{ij}$ terms, while the **Augmented Matrix** ($[A|\mathbf{b}]$) includes the constant vector $\mathbf{b}$ to capture all the system's information in a single structure.

### Definition: Elementary Row Operations (ERO)
The following operations do not change the solution set of a system:
1. **Replacement**: Add a multiple of one row to another.
2. **Interchange**: Swap two rows.
3. **Scaling**: Multiply a row by a non-zero constant.

### Definition: REF and RREF
- **Row Echelon Form (REF)**: A stair-step pattern where the leading entry (pivot) of each row is to the right of the pivot of the row above it.
- **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**: An REF where every pivot is 1, and each column containing a pivot has zeros elsewhere.

### Algorithm: Row Reduction
Row Reduction is performed in two distinct phases to achieve symmetry and precision.



#### 1. Forward Phase (To REF - Gaussian Elimination)
This phase transforms the matrix into **Row Echelon Form (REF)**.
- **Step 1**: Find the leftmost non-zero column (the pivot column).
- **Step 2**: Move a non-zero entry to the pivot position using **Interchange**.
- **Step 3**: Use **Replacement** to create zeros in all positions below the pivot.
- **Step 4**: Repeat for the remaining sub-matrix until REF is achieved.

#### 2. Backward Phase (To RREF - Gauss-Jordan Elimination)
This phase further transforms the REF matrix into **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**.
- **Step 1**: Start with the rightmost pivot and work upward and to the left.
- **Step 2**: Use **Scaling** to make the pivot equal to 1.
- **Step 3**: Use **Replacement** to create zeros in all positions above the pivot.
- **Step 4**: Repeat until the leftmost pivot is reached.

## Column Picture: Structural Insights

The Column Picture $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ reveals existence and uniqueness:

**Theorem: Existence and Uniqueness**
- If the columns of $A$ **span** $\mathbb{R}^m$, then $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is **consistent** for every $\mathbf{b}$ (existence).
- If the columns of $A$ are **linearly independent**, the solution (if it exists) is **unique** (uniqueness).

## Deep Thoughts of Jo: Dimension as the Boundary of Logic

Dimension is the **critical boundary** of a vector space. It is the **maximum** number of elements that can be linearly independent, and the **minimum** number of elements required to span the space. 

By applying this logic to an $m \times n$ matrix $A$:

**1. Case $m > n$ (Tall Matrix)**
- **Column Picture**: Since $n < m$, the columns **cannot span** $\mathbb{R}^m$. The system is likely **overdetermined**, meaning many vectors $\mathbf{b}$ will have no solution.

**2. Case $m < n$ (Wide Matrix)**
- **Column Picture**: Since $n > m$, the columns **must be linearly dependent**. The system is likely **underdetermined**, often leading to infinitely many solutions if consistent.

## Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous Systems

### Definition: Homogeneous vs. Nonhomogeneous
- **Homogeneous**: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. The solution set is the **Null Space** (Kernel) of $A$, which is a subspace.
- **Nonhomogeneous**: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ ($b \neq \mathbf{0}$). 

### Theorem: General Solution Structure
If $\mathbf{x}_p$ is a **particular solution** to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{x}_h$ is the general solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$, then:
$$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_p + \mathbf{x}_h$$
The entire solution set is a **shifted version** of the Null Space.
