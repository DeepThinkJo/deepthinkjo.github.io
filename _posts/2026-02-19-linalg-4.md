# Linear Systems

A **Linear System** is essentially a collection of linear equations involving multiple unknowns. While the definition sounds simple, its implications are profound. Through the process of mathematical modeling, complex real-world problems—ranging from structural engineering to neural network optimizations—can be translated into these systems. As engineers, mastering linear systems is not just an academic exercise; it is the acquisition of a vital tool for solving the problems of reality.

## Linear System and the Nature of Solution Sets

To solve a problem, we must first define it clearly. A linear system is our framework for defining relationships between variables.

### Definition: Linear System
A system of $m$ linear equations in $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is defined as:
$$
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \dots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \dots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m
\end{cases}
$$

### Definition: Solution and Solution Set
A **solution** is a list of numbers $(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)$ that makes each equation in the system a true statement. The **solution set** is the collection of all such possible solutions.

### Theorem: The Three Possibilities
Because these equations possess the property of **linearity**, their solution sets behave in a very specific manner. A linear system has either:
1. **No solution** (Inconsistent)
2. **Exactly one solution** (Consistent)
3. **Infinitely many solutions** (Consistent)

## Vector Equations and Matrix Equations are Linear Systems Themselves!

In the world of Linear Algebra, we often represent the same problem in different forms. We do this not to complicate things, but to utilize different mathematical tools: some forms are better for **calculation** (Row Picture), while others are better for **structural analysis** (Column Picture).

To establish this, let us define the following components:
* **Coefficient Matrix**: $A = [ \mathbf{a}_1 \ \mathbf{a}_2 \ \dots \ \mathbf{a}_n ]$, where each $\mathbf{a}_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a column vector.
* **Variable Vector**: $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]^T \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
* **Constant Vector**: $\mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]^T \in \mathbb{R}^m$.

### Theorem: Triple Equivalence of Linear Systems
Based on the definitions above, the following three representations are **equivalent**, meaning they share the exact same solution set:

1.  **The Linear System Form**: The traditional collection of $m$ equations in $n$ unknowns.
2.  **The Vector Equation Form**: $x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + \dots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{b}$
3.  **The Matrix Equation Form**: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$

**Proof & Justification**:
This equivalence follows directly from the **definition of matrix-vector multiplication**. By definition, the product $A\mathbf{x}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$ using the corresponding entries of $\mathbf{x}$ as weights:
$$A\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \mathbf{a}_i = x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + \dots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n$$
This sum results in a vector where each $j$-th entry is exactly the left-hand side of the $j$-th equation in the linear system. Thus, solving for $\mathbf{x}$ in $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ is identical to solving the original system.

## Two Perspectives: Row Picture and Column Picture

Based on the equivalence above, we can gain different levels of insight by categorizing them into the **Row Picture** and the **Column Picture**.

### 1. The Row Picture: Focusing on Individual Equations
This perspective treats the system as a collection of $m$ equations. Geometrically, the solution is the **intersection** of hyperplanes. This view is practical for calculating the actual solution set through row operations.

### 2. The Column Picture: Focusing on Vector Operations
This perspective treats the system as a **Vector Equation**. We look for the coefficients $x_i$ that combine the columns $\{\mathbf{a}_1, \dots, \mathbf{a}_n\}$ to reach the target vector $\mathbf{b}$. This view is essential for analyzing the system's structural properties through concepts like *Spanning* and *Linear Independence*.

## Deep Thoughts of Jo: The Necessity of Elimination Algorithms

Let’s dive into the Row Picture and discuss how to solve these systems. Why do we need formal **Elimination Algorithms**?

**1. Scalability and Computational Efficiency**
Solving a system with two variables is easy. But for an engineer dealing with 1,000 equations, we need a clear, systematic, and algorithmic approach that a computer can execute without making arithmetic errors.

**2. Breaking the "Equation Count" Intuition**
A common naive intuition is: *"If $n$ unknowns and $m$ equations, then $n > m$ means infinite solutions, $m > n$ means no solution, and $m = n$ means a unique solution."*
However, this is **often wrong**. Consider the system $\{x+y=1, x+y=2\}$. Even though $m=n$, there is no solution. Elimination algorithms act as a filter that reveals the true structure and "traps" within the system by transforming it into an equivalent form.

## Row Picture: The Mechanics of Row Reduction

To apply the Row Picture systematically, we use matrix notation.

### Definition: Coefficient Matrix and Augmented Matrix
For a system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, the **Coefficient Matrix** ($A$) contains only the $a_{ij}$ terms, while the **Augmented Matrix** ($[A|\mathbf{b}]$) includes the constant vector $\mathbf{b}$ to capture all the system's information in a single structure.

### Definition: Elementary Row Operations (ERO)
The following operations do not change the solution set of a system:
1. **Replacement**: Add a multiple of one row to another.
2. **Interchange**: Swap two rows.
3. **Scaling**: Multiply a row by a non-zero constant.

### Definition: REF and RREF
- **Row Echelon Form (REF)**: A stair-step pattern where the leading entry (pivot) of each row is to the right of the pivot of the row above it.
- **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**: An REF where every pivot is 1, and each column containing a pivot has zeros elsewhere.

### Algorithm: Row Reduction
Row Reduction is performed in two distinct phases to achieve symmetry and precision.



#### 1. Forward Phase (To REF - Gaussian Elimination)
- **Step 1**: Find the leftmost non-zero column (the pivot column).
- **Step 2**: Move a non-zero entry to the pivot position using **Interchange**.
- **Step 3**: Use **Replacement** to create zeros in all positions below the pivot.
- **Step 4**: Repeat for the remaining sub-matrix until REF is achieved.

#### 2. Backward Phase (To RREF - Gauss-Jordan Elimination)
- **Step 1**: Start with the rightmost pivot and work upward and to the left.
- **Step 2**: Use **Scaling** to make the pivot equal to 1.
- **Step 3**: Use **Replacement** to create zeros in all positions above the pivot.
- **Step 4**: Repeat until the leftmost pivot is reached.

## Column Picture: Structural Insights

The Column Picture $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ reveals existence and uniqueness:

**Theorem: Existence and Uniqueness**
- If the columns of $A$ **span** $\mathbb{R}^m$, then $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is **consistent** for every $\mathbf{b}$ (existence).
- If the columns of $A$ are **linearly independent**, the solution (if it exists) is **unique** (uniqueness).

## Deep Thoughts of Jo: Dimension as the Boundary of Logic

Dimension is the **critical boundary** of a vector space. It is the **maximum** number of elements that can be linearly independent, and simultaneously, the **minimum** number of elements required to span the space. It is the equilibrium point where both conditions are satisfied.

Through dimension, we can obtain information about the properties of a set (such as linear independence or spanning) simply by the number of elements in that set. If the number of elements is less than the dimension, it cannot span the space. If it is greater, it must be linearly dependent.

We can apply this directly to an $m \times n$ linear system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$:

**1. Case $m > n$ (Tall Matrix)**
* **From the Row Picture perspective**: We can judge that the system is likely **overdetermined**.
* **From the Column Picture perspective**: The columns of $A$ can **never span** $\mathbb{R}^m$ because the number of vectors ($n$) is less than the dimension ($m$). Therefore, we can conclude that there may be cases where no solution exists because $\mathbf{b}$ lies outside the span of the columns.

**2. Case $m < n$ (Wide Matrix)**
* **From the Row Picture perspective**: We can judge that the system is likely **underdetermined**.
* **From the Column Picture perspective**: The columns of $A$ can **never be linearly independent** because the number of vectors ($n$) exceeds the dimension ($m$). However, since there are more than $m$ vectors, there is a high possibility they will **span** $\mathbb{R}^m$. This allows us to judge that a solution likely exists, or furthermore, there could be infinitely many solutions.

By understanding dimension as this "boundary," we can predict the structural behavior of a linear system just by glancing at its shape ($m \times n$), even before we begin the first step of row reduction.

## Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous Systems

### Definition: Homogeneous vs. Nonhomogeneous
- **Homogeneous**: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. The solution set is the **Null Space** (Kernel) of $A$, which is a subspace.
- **Nonhomogeneous**: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ ($b \neq \mathbf{0}$). 

### Theorem: General Solution Structure
If $\mathbf{x}_p$ is a **particular solution** to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{x}_h$ is the general solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$, then:
$$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_p + \mathbf{x}_h$$
The entire solution set is a **shifted version** of the Null Space.
