# Hello, I'm Seunghwan Jo! 👋

Welcome to my personal archive. I am an **aspiring engineer** who is deeply passionate about uncovering the fundamental principles of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. 

Rather than simply consuming information, I strive to build a solid foundation that will eventually allow me to contribute meaningfully to the field of AI.

## 💡 My Philosophy

I believe that the mindset of an engineer defines the quality of their solutions. Here are the core principles I follow in my journey:

### 1. Purpose-Driven Learning
I believe that understanding the **purpose and motivation** behind a subject is just as vital as mastering the content itself. Knowing "why" I am learning something fuels my consistency and depth of understanding.

### 2. Strategic Connection (Top-down Approach)
I utilize a **top-down approach** as a learning strategy to bridge the gap between my current studies and my ultimate goals. By maintaining this perspective, I can see how individual mathematical concepts serve the larger architecture of AI systems.

### 3. Abstraction and Generalization
"Knowledge is most valuable when it serves as a tool for problem-solving". To achieve this, I cultivate the habit of **abstracting** complex problems and **generalizing** solutions, turning specific information into versatile engineering tools.
