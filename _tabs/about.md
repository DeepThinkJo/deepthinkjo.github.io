# Hello, I'm Seunghwan Jo!

Welcome to my personal archive. I am an **aspiring engineer** who is deeply passionate about uncovering the fundamental principles of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. 

Rather than simply consuming information, I strive to build a solid foundation that will eventually allow me to contribute meaningfully to the field of AI.

## What I Do: A Top-Down Journey into AI/ML

I explore how the fundamental principles of Mathematics and Computer Science serve as powerful tools for solving complex, real-world problems in AI and Machine Learning. Rather than simply listing theories, I take a top-down approach—starting from the problem and descending into the underlying theory to prove its practical utility.

This blog is intended to serve as a precedent for those aspiring to enter the field of AI/ML. By sharing my journey of learning, questioning, and finding answers, I aim to provide a practical guide and genuine motivation for fellow travelers on this path.

## The Core of This Blog: "Deep Thoughts of Jo"

The posts here serve various purposes—from organizing foundational knowledge and clarifying confusing concepts to documenting the outcomes of my personal projects. Amidst these records, you will find the "Deep Thoughts of Jo" sections, which define the identity of this blog.

Through these sections, I deliver two core values:

1. Questions for the Textbook
Textbooks must be conservative, focusing on established, rigorous facts. However, "Deep Thoughts of Jo" dares to go beyond. I focus on the expansion, connection, and ultimate purpose of knowledge, often asking challenging questions that look at concepts from a more multidimensional perspective.

2. Top-down Motivation
Knowledge gains true value only when it is applied. I constantly reflect on how the theory I am studying connects to specific problems in AI/ML. By bridging the gap between an abstract piece of mathematics and its role in a real-world model, I provide readers with a powerful sense of purpose that transcends mere rote learning.
